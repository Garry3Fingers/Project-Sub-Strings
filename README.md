# Project-Sub-Strings
In this project I need to implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. t should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

I think I'll need to use method like String#include?. I'll also need Enumerable#find_all.
